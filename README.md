# BOSH real --dry-run

This tool allows running a real dry-run (without side effects) for a given deployment.
After running the tool it will print a diff of all outstanding configs changes,
as well as changes to the deployment manfiest.

## Installation

- [bosh](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

```
git clone http://github.com/starkandwayne/bosh-real-dry-run
cd bosh-real-dry-run
./diff.sh {deployment_name} {new_deployment_manifest}.yml

# Motivation for creating this tool
Currently `bosh deploy --dry-run` has side effects.

As @mrosecrance puts it [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/2274#issuecomment-692179611):
```
This is an unfortunate known issue, --dry-run has side effects that need a deploy to resolve.
Our current expectations around use is that it's used to validate what will happen and then a changed manifest is deployed.
